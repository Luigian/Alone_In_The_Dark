# C Exam Alone In The Dark

This is a collection of the exercises that I have faced so far in the "C Exam Alone In The Dark - Beginner". These exams allowed me to check my achievements when i was alone in front of the computer, without peers and without internet. To validate this 42 project (which is a prerequisite for my departure in the 1st stage), i must validate 5 exams with a minimum score of 75, which  means be able to succed on exercises of level 4.

### Key points:

* Basics of C
* Basics in algorithmics
* Integration of header, main and function files.
* Compiling using a Makefile.
* Strings and memory manipulation.
* Linked lists manage.

### Objectives:

* Basics of C.
* Basics in algorithmics.

### Skills:

* Imperative programming.
* Rigor.
* Algorithms & AI.

### Compilation:

(All exercises in this collection include a main, even those that are not required by the subject for the purpose of the exam).

`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror "file_exercise"` | For exercises that do not use a header.
`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror "file_exercise" -I "file_header"` | For exercises that include a header.

`./a.out` | For exercises with arguments supplied from inside the program.
`./a.out "string_1" "string_2" "string_3"` | For exercises that expects command line arguments.
