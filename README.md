# C Exam Alone In The Dark

This is a collection of the exercises that I have faced so far in the "C Exam Alone In The Dark - Beginner". These exams allow me to check my achievements when i am alone in front of the computer, without peers and without internet. To validate this 42 project (which is a prerequisite for my departure in the 1st stage), i must validate 5 exams with a minimum score of 75, that means, be able to succed on exercises of level 4.

### Key points:

* Basics of C

* Basics in algorithmics

* Integration of header, main and function files.

* Compiling using a Makefile.

* Strings and memory manipulation.

* Linked lists manage.


### Compilation:

`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror "file_" libft.a && ./a.out`| Compile a main with the library, and then run the program.

`make all`| First time compilation.

`make fclean`
| Delete files generated from compilation.

`make re`| Delete files generated from compilation and recompile.


### Execution:

`gcc "file_main" libft.a && ./a.out`| Compile a main with the library, and then run the program.
