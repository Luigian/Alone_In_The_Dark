# Alone In The Dark
## A collection of C Exam Exercises

These are the exercises that I have faced so far in the "C Exam Alone In The Dark", beginner and intermediate levels, of 42 School. These exams allow usme to check our achievements when we were alone in front of the computer, without peers and without internet. To validate "Beginners" level (which is a prerequisite for "Intermediate"), we must validate 5 exams with a minimum score of 75, which  means be able to succed on exercises of level 4. To validate "Intermediate" level, we must validate 5 exams with a minimum score of 85.
